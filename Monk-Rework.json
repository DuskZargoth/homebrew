However, to be considered a monk, it is required that one persistently and rigurously trains body and spirit, for they believe that only when both work in harmony and are pushed past its limitations everyday that one can reach their perfect self. Such is the goal of every monk. It is for that purpose that many monastic traditions have been created, for the path is unique for each individual.",

Thus, those who leave their cloisters don't undertake this change lightly. They work diligently, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. Monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."
