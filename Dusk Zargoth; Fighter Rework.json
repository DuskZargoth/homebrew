Such is the goal of every monk. It is for that purpose that many Martial Archetypes have been created, for the path is unique for each individual.",

In some cases, they embark themselves on a meaningful journey for self discovery.",

								"The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.",

								"For a monk, becoming an adventurer is a harsh transition. It means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. Thus, those who leave their cloisters don't undertake this change lightly. They work diligently, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. Monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."

								"As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? And why did you choose to study your discipline?",
								
								"Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?",

								"As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment."

Other abilities allow you to reroll the die for those die rolls, such as the drunken master monk's Drunkard's Luck. There is another type of abilities, much rarer than the others, ones that allow you to add special effects to your actions, reactions, die rolls, etc., such as the monk's Evasion ki feature. These abilities have in common the lack of key words for its trigger, such as hit, succeed, miss, or fail, which is why you can choose to use these after seeing the roll, but before the DM says wether the roll succeeds or fails."
