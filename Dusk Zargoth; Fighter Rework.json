This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse-specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects, exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, or alter the state of a creature by manipulating their ki. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes."

								"Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.",

								"A monastery welcomes anyone seeking refuge, and all its inhabitants must abide by its community rules. However, to be considered a monk, it is required that one persistently and rigurously trains body and spirit, for they believe that only when both work in harmony and are pushed past its limitations everyday that one can reach their perfect self. Such is the goal of every monk. It is for that purpose that many Martial Archetypes have been created, for the path is unique for each individual.",

								"Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve their mentor or a divine power, often to fulfill a spiritual task, others to carry out an important mission. In some cases, they embark themselves on a meaningful journey for self discovery.",

								"The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.",

								"For a monk, becoming an adventurer is a harsh transition. It means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. Thus, those who leave their cloisters don't undertake this change lightly. They work diligently, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. Monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than slaying monsters and plundering their treasure."

Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? And why did you choose to study your discipline?",

Are you eager to return to your home?",

Other abilities allow you to reroll the die for those die rolls, such as the drunken master monk's Drunkard's Luck.
