								"As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.",
								
								"You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace."

First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee or ranged weapons. Your next highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt a magical subclass. Second, choose the {@background soldier} background.",

Other abilities allow you to reroll the die for those die rolls, such as the drunken master monk's Drunkard's Luck. There is another type of abilities, much rarer than the others, ones that allow you to add special effects to your actions, reactions, die rolls, etc., such as the monk's Evasion ki feature. These abilities have in common the lack of key words for its trigger, such as hit, succeed, miss, or fail, which is why you can choose to use these after seeing the roll, but before the DM says wether the roll succeeds or fails."
